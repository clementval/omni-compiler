Tiny test progarams from OpenMP C API 1.0 Appendix A. Examples.

NOTES:

1. Following test programs are not suitable for the OpenMP
   specfications, and compilation might be failed:

  Compile failed:
    tiny19-1.c tiny19-3.c tiny19-4.c tiny19-5.c
    tiny22-2.c tiny22-3.c

  Compiled successfully but execution result says "FAILED":
    tiny19-2.c tiny20.c


2. "tiny22-1.c" is a valid OpenMP'd program, but compilation with Omni
   failed because of its bug.


3. "tiny11.c" is a valid program and Omni can compile it successfully,
   execution success EXCEPT SCASH configuration. Because OpenMP
   runtime for SCASH doesn't support omp_set_thread_num().
